= Uvod v Kotlin

This is the source behind the slides used to create the Introduction to Kotlin talk for CafeBabe in November 2017.
You will need Ruby and Bundler to compile it (sorry!).
You can either run `prez` to compile the presentation or `prez-watch` to have it auto-compile on changes.

The whole thing will also be available at https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/publicstash/uvod-v-kotlin/prez.html
